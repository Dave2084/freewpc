Hold right flipper button to show last scores.

Skill Shot
==========
Launch the ball and try to land in the yellow zone for maximum points.
Skill shot awarded becomes the minimum score for the next skill shot.

Super Duper Skill Shot
======================
When the ball is in the plunger just before the skill shot, hold down the
right flipper button for 3 seconds to activate 'Super Duper Skill Shot'.  Now
plunge the ball straight into the slot (ie miss the skill shot on purpose).
When the ball comes out of the slot, shoot the left ramp for 10M, incrementing
in 10M steps up to 50M each successful attempt.

Inlanes
=======
These can be stepped left and right using the flipper buttons, complete a
set of 3 rollovers for 1M on your score and 1M towards your bonus.  4 complete
rollover sets lights the camera.

Spiralaward
===========
When either left inlane rollover is lit, you have 3 seconds to fire the
ball into the right loop.  If successful you will be randomly awarded one of
the Spiralawards.  You will not be awarded the 'extra ball lit' Spiralaward until
you have collected at least 4 Spiralawards.

Once all Spiralawards have been collected, you are awarded 20M and every
Spiralaward apart from the extra ball is relit.  To retrigger the Spiralaward
once it has been completed once requires you to complete a rollover set.

Left Ramps
==========
Ramp count gets reset at the end of each ball.

Awards

Deadends
========

Gumball
=======
Loading the gumball with a steel ball awards 5M, going up by 5M each time
capped at 30M.

Loading with the powerball scores another 20M and randomly starts 'Super Skill
Shot' or 'Clock Chaos' 3 ball multiball, with the piano jackpot lit also.

Camera
======

- The Camera door panel
- The Super Slot round
- 3 left ramps
- 4 Rollovers

Awards (in order)
- Light lock
- 10 Million points
- Award door panel 
- 20 Million points

 capped at 50M.  If the jackpot is not lit, 3 camera shots will relight it.

Hitchhikers
===========
Unlocks the Mini playfield every 5 hitchhikers until 20 hitchhikers, every 10
after that.  Hit during Hitchhiker round to score 10M, otherwise 250K is
scored.

- 5 Hitchhikers (or every 10 if hitchhikers >30)
- 'Battle the Power' door panel
- 'Battle the power' spiral award

A jackpot will count down over the course of 10 seconds, which can be
collected along with a door panel by sending the ball into the top hole.

If you manage to sneak in a ball during multiball, you get some points too.

Multiball
=========
If no jackpot is scored and 2 balls drain, the player is offered a multiball
restart.  This is collected by hitting the lock within 30 seconds of multiball
ending.  Jackpots can be increased by hitting the camera whilst the jackpot is
lit, up to a maximum of 50 Million.  Once collected, the jackpot can be 
relit by hitting the lock or 3 cameras.

If 3 balls are in play when the jackpot is collected, 10M is added to the
jackpot.  If the Powerball is used to collect the jackpot, the jackpot is
doubled.

If you play around midnight, strange things might happen.....

Note: There is also 'Clock Chaos' and 'Super Skill' multiball modes, details
in the 'Door Panels' section.
